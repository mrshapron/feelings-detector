Speaker 1: You made two Wonder Woman movies since the last time I'm.
Speaker 2: So excited.
Speaker 1: You've been Wonder Woman, are you?
Speaker 2: I feel like I would spit it out of a tornado.
Speaker 2: It's been a hell of a year.
Speaker 2: I'm so happy and grateful for this year that I had.
Speaker 2: We shot right after keeping up with the Joneses.
Speaker 2: We shot the Wonder Woman movie, the solo one, which is going to be out in June.
Speaker 2: And right when I finished that one, I started to shoot Justice League with everyone.
Speaker 1: Right back in the costume.
